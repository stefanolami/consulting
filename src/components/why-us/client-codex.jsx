				CLIENT CODEX
			</h1>
			<p className="mb-6 lg:mb-10">
				The relations we establish with our clients are just as
				important as our relations with governmental decision-makers.
				Public Affairs and Public Relations are about communication, and
				therefore about people. We focus on trust and long-term vision
				which are key to any healthy business based on human
				interaction. An excellent reputation is one of many symptoms
				thereof. Our client codex is a tribute to this.
			</p>
			<h2 className="font-unna font-bold text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl mb-3 lg:mb-5">
				We don’t sell opportunities where there are none
			</h2>
			<p className="mb-6 lg:mb-10">
				Our goal is to provide you added value and results. Creating an
				opportunity and failing to carry it out as there was none in the
				first place is counter to a positive progress report which is
				important for any standing.
			</p>
			<h2 className="font-unna font-bold text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl mb-3 lg:mb-5">
				We don’t look to maximize billable days
			</h2>
			<p className="mb-6 lg:mb-10">
				Our competitive edge is primarily our experience and our
				long-term approach to all stakeholders we engage with, but no
				partnership goes without a discussion about a competitive price.
				This is also why we promote a flexible workforce policy where
				contracts do not have to cover non-profitable branches of one’s
				organization.
			</p>
			<h2 className="font-unna font-bold text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl mb-3 lg:mb-5">
				If we can’t do it, we don’t pretend we can
			</h2>
			<p className="mb-6 lg:mb-10">
				We don’t do learning as we go along at the expense of our
				clients. If our experience, networks and understanding are not
				suitable to carry out your needs, we don’t accept the project.
				Instead, we try our best to help you find someone that can.
			</p>
			<h2 className="font-unna font-bold text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl mb-3 lg:mb-5">
				Who you meet is who you get
			</h2>
			<p className="mb-6 lg:mb-10">
				We don’t push our tasks to colleagues with less experience
				pretending to take on the work ourselves.
			</p>
			<h2 className="font-unna font-bold text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl mb-3 lg:mb-5">
				We avoid conflicts of interest
			</h2>
			<p className="mb-6 lg:mb-10">
				If potential new clients could create a conflict of interest, we
				double check with our clientele before taking on new projects.
