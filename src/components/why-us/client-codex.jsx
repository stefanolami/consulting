					CLIENT CODEX
				</h1>
				<p className="mb-6 lg:mb-10">
					The relations we establish with our clients are just as
					important as our relations with governmental
					decision-makers. Public Affairs and Public Relations are
					about communication, and therefore about people. We focus on
					trust and long-term vision which are key to any healthy
					business based on human interaction. An excellent reputation
					is one of many symptoms thereof. Our client codex is a
					tribute to this.
				</p>
				<h2 className="font-unna font-bold text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl mb-3 lg:mb-5">
					We don’t sell opportunities where there are none
				</h2>
				<p className="mb-6 lg:mb-10">
					Our goal is to provide you added value and results. Creating
					an opportunity and failing to carry it out as there was none
					in the first place is counter to a positive progress report
					which is important for any standing.
				</p>
				<h2 className="font-unna font-bold text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl mb-3 lg:mb-5">
					We don’t look to maximize billable days
				</h2>
				<p className="mb-6 lg:mb-10">
					Our competitive edge is primarily our experience and our
					long-term approach to all stakeholders we engage with, but
					no partnership goes without a discussion about a competitive
					price. This is also why we promote a flexible workforce
					policy where contracts do not have to cover non-profitable
					branches of one’s organisation.
				</p>
				<h2 className="font-unna font-bold text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl mb-3 lg:mb-5">
					If we can’t do it, we don’t pretend we can
				</h2>
				<p className="mb-6 lg:mb-10">
					We don’t do learning as we go along at the expense of our
					clients. If our experience, networks and understanding are
					not suitable to carry out your needs, we don’t accept the
					project. Instead, we try our best to help you find someone
					that can.
				</p>
				<h2 className="font-unna font-bold text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl mb-3 lg:mb-5">
					Who you meet is who you get
				</h2>
				<p className="mb-6 lg:mb-10">
					We don’t push our tasks to colleagues with less experience
					pretending to take on the work ourselves.
				</p>
				<h2 className="font-unna font-bold text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl mb-3 lg:mb-5">
					We avoid conflicts of interest
				</h2>
				<p className="mb-6 lg:mb-10">
					If potential new clients could create a conflict of
					interest, we double check with our clientele before taking
					on new projects.
