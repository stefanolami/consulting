		title: 'The European Union and Latin America: A Herculean Matter',
		intro: 'Europe and Latin America share a long and complex history, bound by language, culture, and values. For centuries, their destinies have been linked. Yet this relationship has often been taken for granted, regarded more as a historical legacy than as a forward-looking strategic partnership. That complacency was reflected in the eight-year silence of EU–CELAC summits between 2015 and 2023, when “relationship fatigue” set in and the dialogue was put on ice. The breakthrough came in July 2023, when Brussels hosted the third EU–CELAC summit under the Spanish Presidency of the Council of the EU1. Leaders pledged a new roadmap for 2023–25 and launched the Global Gateway Investment Agenda (GGIA) for Latin America and the Caribbean. Two years on, the next summit is set to take place in Santa Marta, Colombia, in November 2025, with the potential to mark a decisive turning point2. Much like Hercules facing his labours, Europe now confronts its own trials: securing energy transition, building resilient supply chains and competing in a messy geopolitical arena. ',

				title: 'Where EU–LATAM Relations Stand ',
				content: [
					'Institutionally, the partnership is structured around the EU–CELAC summits and ministerial meetings, with parliamentary diplomacy supported by the EuroLat Assembly, a transnational body composed of MEPs and parliamentarians of different Latin American regional bodies, such as the Andean Parliament and the Parliament of Mercosur. Newer initiatives, such as the EU–LAC Digital Alliance (2023) and memoranda on climate, disaster-risk management, and narcotics control, show that cooperation is broadening. But when it comes to trade, the action often lies in sub-regional or bilateral tracks. The EU has agreements in force with Central America, CARIFORUM, and the Andean states, while new deals were concluded with Mexico (modernised Global Agreement, January 2025) and Chile (Interim Trade Agreement, February 2025). Both contain state-of-the-art chapters on sustainability, raw materials, and digitalisation, reflecting the EU’s shift toward green and digital geopolitics. Another crucial investment and trade partner is Mercosur, with whom the EU reached a political agreement with in December 2024, and is now waiting for ratification in national parliaments. In September 2025, the Commission formally tabled both the Mercosur and Mexico Agreements for adoption, presenting them as giant steps to diversify trade, strengthen value chains and tie Europe closer to Latin America. Economically, the EU remains a heavyweight. It is Latin America’s third largest trading partner after the U.S. and China, with trade in goods worth nearly €300 billion in 2022. Based on EEAS, it is also by far the largest foreign investor, with €741 billion in FDI in 2022. Yet politics remain more complicated. Key Latin American countries, including Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and Colombia, refuse to join Western sanctions on Russia, citing their principle of non-intervention. Periodic debates about Europe’s colonial legacy also complicate the picture. Still, both regions reaffirmed their shared commitments to climate action, inclusive development, and democracy in the 2023 Brussels summit declaration. ',

It is now seeking closer relations with Brazil and Bolivia. Yet most regional powers maintain neutrality, resisting sanctions or arms support to Ukraine. ',
							'China is the real disruptor. In just two decades, trade with the region jumped from $12 billion (2000) to over $500 billion (2024). Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative counts 22 Latin American signatories. The Port of Chancay in Peru, financed by Chinese investors, symbolises this shift. Chinese firms have also poured more than $16 billion into Latin American lithium projects since 2018, positioning Beijing as a direct competitor to Europe in securing raw materials. ',
							'The United States, under Trump, projects volatility. Tariffs, migration restrictions, and aid cuts revive regional anxieties. Leaders like Argentina’s Javier Milei or El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele lean pro-Trump, while others remain cautious, opening space for China, and potentially the EU, to step in. ',
							'Europe’s own regulatory agenda adds friction. The EU Deforestation Regulation, targeting imports of soy, beef, cocoa, and coffee, will only apply from late 2025 for large firms and 2026 for SMEs, but exporters still see it as restrictive. Farmers and governments argue it risks excluding Latin American producers from the EU market if compliance proves too costly.',

				title: 'Mercosur: The Litmus Test ',
				content: [
					'Against this backdrop, the EU–Mercosur Agreement is the defining test. Negotiations began in 1999, reached an “agreement in principle” in 2019, but stalled over sustainability. Regional parliaments made a ratification impossible. A revised deal was struck in December 2024, now with stronger guarantees: the Paris Agreement is an essential clause, deforestation must halt by 2030, and a €1.8 billion Global Gateway fund will support green transition projects in Mercosur countries. The stake is immense. Covering 780 million people and nearly one-quarter of global GDP, this would be the largest inter-regional agreement ever signed. Mercosur would abolish tariffs on 91% of EU goods, eliminating duties as high as 35% on cars, 20% on machinery, and 18% on chemicals. The EU would liberalise 82% of agricultural imports but manage beef, sugar, poultry, and ethanol with quotas. Crucially, 350 Geographical Indications from Parmigiano Reggiano to Irish Whiskey would be protected. For Europe, the deal secures duty-free access to lithium, copper, and other critical raw materials vital for the green transition. For Mercosur, it offers predictable market access, investment, and integration into EU value chains. The political challenge lies at home. France, Austria, Poland, Ireland, and the Netherlands remain sceptical, under pressure from farmers’ unions wary of South American competition. To address those fears, the Commission in September 2025 announced a legal act to operationalise the agreements’ safeguard clause. This clause would allow Brussels to act quickly if imports from Mercosur rise sharply or undercut European prices. Namely, when sales of a product increase by more than 10% and enter the EU market at significantly lower prices, the Commission would open an investigation and when applicable, apply temporary restrictions within three weeks. Moreover, a €6.3 billion “Unity Safety Net” was also proposed for European farmers, to mitigate the risks that can arise from market fluctuations. These two moves are designed to keep the above mentioned skeptical governments on board. Regardless, ratification remains uncertain. As a mixed agreement, ratification would require approval from all 27 EU parliaments, as well as national congresses in Mercosur, a long and uncertain process. If the deal collapses, Europe would suffer a credibility loss in the Global South, ceding ground to China and the U.S. and weakening its leverage to promote climate-aligned trade norms. ',

					'The upcoming Santa Marta summit in Colombia will be the moment of truth. To be seen as a reliable partner rather than a distant regulator, the EU must deliver on Global Gateway projects, from renewable energy corridors to digital infrastructure. Most importantly, the fate of the Mercosur Agreement will define whether Europe is perceived as serious or symbolic in its engagement with the region. For Hercules, each labour was both a test of strength and a chance to prove his place among the gods. For the EU, Latin America plays a similar role: it is central to the struggle for energy, supply chains and global influence. If Brussels can tame the lion of domestic resistance, clean the stables of regulatory mistrust, and seize the golden apple of Mercosur ratification, then what once seemed a Herculean burden may become Europe’s greatest strategic prize.

		title: 'Europe’s Space Economy: Turning flagship projects into growth markets',
		intro: 'Space is no longer a niche sector for frontier science, satellite telecoms and defence. It is quickly becoming one of the fastest-growing economic industries, at a global level, with an exponential increase in attraction of both public investment and private capital. According to the Commission’s new European Space Economy Strategy, the global market could reach $1.8 trillion by 2035, but Europe still underperforms. Galileo, Copernicus and IRIS² are world-class systems. The real question is whether Europe can turn such prestige into scaled businesses, jobs, and competitiveness. In 2023, Europe spent about $15 billion on Space, compared with $73 billion in the U.S. On private capital, EU Space companies attract barely 5% of global venture funding, leaving start-ups without resources once promising firms reach certain high-volume financial thresholds. Too often, such companies then leave the continent. ',

					'The European Commission has already acted in recent years to redress these market discrepancies by better directing EU public policy and investments into the nascent European private Space sector. This has been done through several policy endeavours, including the inception of novel funding schemes, such as the CASSINI initiative, launched within the programming cycles of the EU Space Program. However, it is with its most recent and renewed policy framework on Space, launched through a dedicated Communication on the European Space Economy, that the European Commission is truly attempting a focused and supportive approach for emerging European Space firms, start-ups and SMEs. The Communication on the European Space Economy published earlier this June 2025, seeks to promote cross-border growth by attracting private capital, with a view to being capable of competing globally through a European Single Market for Space.',

					{
						type: 'ordered-list',
						items: [
							'**Creating a European Single Market for Space** primarily through an EU legislative initiative for Space (EU Space Act) intended to cut fragmentation by replacing 27 national systems with one common EU licensing regime. The Act further regulates matters related to spectrum management, standards, including minimum sustainability requirements, and simplified procurement so that European firms can scale faster.',
							'**Accelerating R&I investments**, via future funding programs aimed at leveraging investment in AI, quantum, direct-to-device 5G/6G and in-orbit operations, with dual-use innovations to accelerate and simplify deployment.',
							'**De-risking supply chains**, whereby the Commission is proposing the mapping of dependencies in microelectronics and critical components, using the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP), Cohesion, NextGenerationEU and the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) funds to co-finance EU manufacturing, production and diversification of industrial suppliers.',
							'**Financing Space scale-ups**, through a future CASSINI 2.0 program, expanding seed, growth and debt funding. It is the Commision’s stated intention that the EU would also use advance-purchase contracts and long-term service agreements to give companies predictable and aggregated demand, which is crucial to attract private investors.',
							'**Developing and exporting standards**, through the EU Global Gateway and EU Delegations, Brussels will push European technical norms abroad, combining diplomacy with market access, with the intention of supporting European firms winning third-country tenders.',
							'**Training and supporting Space talent**, by investing in Space-related skills including the expansion of training support addressing cyber, aerospace, AI and quantum, from VET to certified higher education, to help close Europe’s STEM gap.',

				title: 'From Data to Markets',
				content: [
					'The biggest economic opportunity is downstream, namely services built on space data. The EU Copernicus and Galileo satellite constellations already support applications from precision farming to renewable energy grids, logistics and disaster management. The Space strategy supports EU-sovereign cloud and edge services, common data standards and digital marketplaces to help companies (especially SMEs) scale their services within the EU Single Market and abroad. If implemented well, Space could move from complex specialised systems to everyday economic use, powering farms, hospitals, supply chains and logistics. The EU does not lack ideas or technology, but a market that rewards innovation with scale. Demand aggregation, predictable procurement and harmonised rules are the conditions that make SpaceX and Amazon’s Kuiper successful in the U.S. If the EU can reproduce those conditions, European firms will not just compete, they will set standards others must follow.',
					'The European Space Economy Strategy is not just rhetorical. It sets out concrete steps for business generated growth, however the real challenge will be execution, which will require the appropriate level of incentives-driven support targeting the brightest of prospects amongst EU Space start-ups and scale ups in the (aero) Space, satellite and telecom domains.',

				title: 'Understanding AI and the Need for Regulation',
				content: [
					'AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that can analyse data, learn from patterns, and adapt their own behaviour to execute a broad range of tasks.',
					"AI's journey began as a concept rooted in mathematics and computer science. Early pioneers like Alan Turing (creator of the famous “Turing” test) laid the groundwork by envisioning machines capable of intelligent behaviour. Over the decades, advancements in computing power and algorithms have propelled AI from theoretical musings to practical implementations.",
					'AI now encompasses various types, such as machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. In healthcare, AI aids in disease diagnosis and drug discovery. In finance, it optimizes trading strategies and detects fraud. Smart assistants like Siri and Alexa use AI to understand and respond to human language. AI powers recommendation systems on e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Alibaba and Zalando, but also on Netflix and Disney+, tailoring experiences to individual preferences.',
					"AI's transformative potential in every aspect of our life has raised concerns about its ethical use. Additionally, there's a growing debate about the impact of AI on the workforce (jobs of traders, cashiers, customer support representatives, assembly line workers and even drivers are equally at risk of displacement). Indeed, as AI applications continue to proliferate, the need for regulation becomes crucial to ensure responsible AI development.",

					'AI has displayed its revolutionary potential across all human actions, leading to remarkable advancements. Examples of disruptive AI applications include autonomous vehicles, healthcare diagnostics (even predicting Parkinson`s disease), archaeology (discovering new sites, translating ancient languages), legal conclusions, and smart assistants among othersiii. These innovations have the power to revolutionize industries and enhance lives. However, the other side of the coin brings forth complex ethical dilemmas and challenges that require regulatory scrutiny.',
